# Python sample sting manipulation

Using string manipulation in Python to to compare 2 strings, this method can be used to implement search functionality in some Python application or script.  

Usage:
Use the following search functions:
```
string 		= check is searched item is a match
*string 	= check is searched item ends with string
string* 	= check is searched item starts with string
*string* 	= check is searched item contains with string
-x 			= search parameter
```

Script will return ``true`` or ``false`` if 2 strings are matching based on defined criteria.
